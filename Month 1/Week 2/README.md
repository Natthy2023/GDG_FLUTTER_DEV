# Week 2 Exercises

## Overview

During Week 2, the focus was on advancing Dart programming skills by exploring **asynchronous programming**, **exception handling**, and **object-oriented concepts** such as classes and inheritance.

## Exercises Completed

### **1. Fetch User & Orders**

* Simulated network requests to retrieve user details and recent orders.
* Practiced using `async` and `await` to manage asynchronous operations efficiently.

### **2. Custom Exceptions**

* Implemented a custom exception called `InvalidAmountException`.
* Learned how to throw exceptions based on specific conditions.
* Handled errors using `try`, `on`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.

### **3. Classes & Inheritance**

* Created parent and child classes to understand inheritance.
* Practiced method overriding and used `super` to call parent class constructors.

## Key Takeaways

* Asynchronous programming enables non-blocking execution and improves performance.
* Proper exception handling increases program stability and reliability.
* Classes and inheritance help structure code, making it more reusable and maintainable.

## Next Steps

* Explore advanced asynchronous patterns such as `Future.wait` and streams.
* Continue practicing complex exception-handling scenarios.
* Build small Dart projects to strengthen understanding and practical skills.
