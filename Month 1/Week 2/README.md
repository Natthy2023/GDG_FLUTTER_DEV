# Week 2 Exercises

## Overview
This week, we focused on practicing Dart programming concepts including asynchronous programming, exception handling, and classes/inheritance.

## Exercises Completed

1. **Fetch User & Orders**
   - Simulated network requests to fetch user details and recent orders.
   - Learned to use `async` and `await` to handle asynchronous operations.

2. **Custom Exceptions**
   - Created a custom exception `InvalidAmountException`.
   - Practiced throwing exceptions based on conditions.
   - Handled exceptions using `try`, `on`, and `finally`.

3. **Classes & Inheritance**
   - Created parent and child classes.
   - Learned how to override methods and use `super` to call parent constructors.

## Key Takeaways
- Asynchronous programming allows non-blocking operations and better performance.
- Exception handling improves program reliability and robustness.
- Classes and inheritance make code more organized and reusable.

## Next Steps
- Explore more async patterns like `Future.wait` and streams.
- Practice advanced exception handling.
- Build small Dart projects to reinforce learning.
