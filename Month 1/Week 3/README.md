# Week 3

## Overview

In Week 3, the focus was on **Dart collections** and how they can be used to efficiently store, organize, and manage data. We explored **List**, **Set**, and **Map**, along with **Dart null safety** to safely handle nullable values and prevent runtime errors.

## Topics Covered

* Lists in Dart
* Sets in Dart
* Maps in Dart
* Differences between List, Set, and Map
* Removing duplicates using Set
* Key-value data storage with Map
* Set operations (difference and intersection)
* Basics of Dart null safety
* Using `stdin` for user input

## Tasks Completed

### **Task 1: Vocabulary Tracker (Map)**

* Created a `Map` to store vocabulary words as keys and their definitions as values
* Added at least 10 vocabulary entries
* Displayed all words and meanings in a formatted output
* Implemented a search feature to find words
* Displayed a message when a word was not found
* Added extra functionality:

  * Delete a word
  * Count the total number of words learned
  * Display words in alphabetical order

### **Task 2: Event Guest List (Set & Null Safety)**

* Created a `Set` of invited students
* Created a `Set` of confirmed students with nullable values
* Safely removed null values using Dart null safety
* Displayed the total number of invited and confirmed students
* Identified students who did not confirm attendance using set difference
* Detected students who confirmed but were not invited (party crashers 😄)
* Used `stdin` to accept user input for confirmations
* Displayed appropriate messages when all guests confirmed attendance

## Key Learnings

* Lists allow duplicate values and maintain insertion order
* Sets store only unique values and support powerful set operations
* Maps organize data using key-value pairs
* Null safety helps prevent errors caused by null values
* Set difference is useful for identifying missing or unexpected data

## Tools & Language

* Dart programming language
* `dart:io` for input and output

## Outcome

By the end of Week 3, we successfully applied Dart collection types and null safety concepts to real-world scenarios through structured and practical programs.
