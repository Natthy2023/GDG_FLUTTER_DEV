# Week 1 Tasks 

This repository contains my Week 1 Dart programming tasks for Month 1. The tasks focus on input/output, loops, functions, the FizzBuzz problem, and star pattern printing.

## 📝 Task Descriptions

### **Task 1**
A basic Dart program involving user input, output, and simple logic.

### **Task 2 — FizzBuzz**
A Dart implementation of the FizzBuzz problem:
- "Fizz" for multiples of 3
- "Buzz" for multiples of 5
- "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both
- Otherwise, print the number

### **Task 3**
A program that practices:
- Creating and using functions
- Passing parameters
- Displaying results in a clean format

### **Task 4 — Star Patterns**
This folder contains three different star pattern programs, all created using loops.  
It is a simple star pattern based on repetition and looping logic.

## 📌 Week 1 Goals
- Practice Dart syntax  
- Strengthen logic with loops and conditionals  
- Learn how functions work  
- Build pattern-printing skills  
- Improve overall problem-solving ability
