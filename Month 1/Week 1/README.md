# Week 1 Tasks

This repository contains my **Week 1 Dart programming exercises** for **Month 1**. These tasks focus on core Dart fundamentals such as input/output operations, loops, functions, the classic FizzBuzz problem, and star pattern printing.

## 📝 Task Overview

### **Task 1**

A simple Dart program that demonstrates:

* User input
* Output display
* Basic logical operations

### **Task 2 — FizzBuzz**

An implementation of the FizzBuzz challenge in Dart:

* Prints **"Fizz"** for numbers divisible by 3
* Prints **"Buzz"** for numbers divisible by 5
* Prints **"FizzBuzz"** for numbers divisible by both
* Otherwise, prints the number itself

### **Task 3**

A program designed to practice:

* Defining and calling functions
* Passing parameters to functions
* Displaying results in a clear and readable format

### **Task 4 — Star Patterns**

This section includes three different star pattern programs created using loops.
The focus is on repetition and loop-based logic to generate simple patterns.

## 📌 Week 1 Objectives

* Get comfortable with Dart syntax
* Strengthen logical thinking using loops and conditionals
* Understand how functions work
* Practice pattern printing
* Improve overall problem-solving skills
